DJANGO EXAMPLE PACKAGE
======================

This package implements an example consumer and server for the Django
Python web framework.  You can get Django (and learn more about it) at

  http://www.djangoproject.com/

SETUP
=====

 1. Install the OpenID library, version 2.0.0 or later.

 2. Install Django 0.95.1.

    If you find that the examples run on even newer versions of
    Django, please let us know!

 3. Modify djopenid/settings.py appropriately; you may wish to change
    the database type or path, although the default settings should be
    sufficient for most systems.

 4. In examples/djopenid/ run these commands:

    A. python manage.py syncdb

    B. pyhton manage.py runserver

    This will initialize the Django environment and run a
    single-process web server (usually on localhost, port 8000) which
    you can visit to try out the functionality.
