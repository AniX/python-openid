The examples directory contains a working server and consumer that
use the openid libraries.  They are both written using python's standard
BaseHTTPServer.

To get the example system running:

1) Start the consumer server:

	python examples/httpconsumer.py

2) In a different terminal, start the server:

	python examples/sampleserver.py


3) Open your web browser, and go to the consumer server:

	http://localhost:8081/

	and type your identity url:

        http://localhost:8082/whoever
