The examples directory contains a working server and consumer that
use the openid libraries.  They are both written using python's standard
BaseHTTPServer.

To get the example system running:

1) Create an identity webpage with contents like:

	<html>
	  <head>
	    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://localhost:8082" />
  	  </head>
	  <body>This is my identity webpage</body>
	</html>

2) Put your identity webpage in a public place, like on your local
apache webserver (if you have one).

3) Start the consumer server:

	python examples/httpconsumer.py

4) In a different terminal, start the server:

	python examples/server.py


5) Open your web browser, and go to the consumer server:

	http://localhost:8081/

	and type your identity url into the form:

	http://localhost/myidentity.html (see step 1)
