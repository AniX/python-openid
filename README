GETTING STARTED

LOGGING

This library offers a logging hook that will record unexpected
conditions that occur in library code. If a condition is recoverable,
the library will recover and issue a log message. If it is not
recoverable, the library will raise an exception. See the
documentation for the openid.oidutil module for more on the logging
hook.
